MIRO – Minimum Information for Reporting of an Ontology
==============

----



## A. Basics

### A.1 Ontology name

Waste sorting to enhance recycling management.

### A.2 Ontology owner

Renaud LEURQUIN (renaud.leurquin@telecom-paris.fr) 
<br /> 
Paul MAYER (paul.mayer@telecom-paris.fr)
<br /> 
Quentin LECLECH (quentin.leclech@telecom-paris.fr)

### A.3 Ontology license

No license


### A.4 Ontology URL

### A.5 Ontology repository

https://github.com/renaud-paul-quentin/ontology-project/tree/main

## B. Motivation

### B.1 Need

This ontology has been created to reduce waste pollution. The lack of shared knowledge about how those waste should be treated or recycled leads to situation where materials and substances that could be re-used or recycled are simply considered as mere waste by their producers (industries, people, corporations, …) who merely discard it. This ontology allows to classify any waste according to some descriptors and allows people to develop waste management skills.

### B.2 Competition

The paper "Using OWL Ontologies for Selective Waste Sorting and
Recycling" describes an ontology on efficient processing of collective waste items. But this paper focuses on RFID technology which would bear the description of waste properties. They have demonstrated a model using OWL ontology to sort these smart waste items for better recycling
of materials. A link to the ontology report : https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00924427/document.

### B.3 Target audience

This ontology is useful to anyone, whether for an industry which has poor knowledge about the waste sorting and on how to handle waste according to its nature and descriptors described above, or an individual who do not know how to get rid of a particular waste while acting in a respectful way towards the environment. This will also be useful for waste management entities which gathers, treat and transform waste. Sometimes, the lack of regulation at a national scale leads to situation where reusable waste or waste containing dangerous chemical substance are burned, which leads to catastrophically environmental situations. 

## C. Scope, requirements, development community

### C.1 Scope and coverage

The fields of interest of the ontology are waste sorting and sustainable development.


### C.2 Development community

The ontology is developed by Renaud LEURQUIN, Paul MAYER and Quentin LECLECH.

## D. Knowledge acquisition

### D.1 Knowledge acquisition methodology

The requirements of the ontology have been defined by the group by brainstorming the key areas
of interest as well as the desirable features of such an ontology. 

### D.2 Source knowledge location

To realize this ontology, we plan to gather waste information by specific categories of waste in order to know the different classes the ontology should have.

## E. Ontology content

### E.1 Knowledge Representation language
Owl version 3.0.3 

### E.2 Development environment
Protégé


### E.3 Entity metadata policy

Each entity is defined by a natural language definition.


## F. Managing Change

### F.1 Sustainability plan 
The ontology will not be actively maintained and developed

### F.2 Entity deprecation strategy 

No class is deleted from the ontology but obsolete classes will be annotated.


## G. Quality Assurance

### G.1 Testing

The ontology was successfully classified by the reasoner HermiT 1.3.8 (i.e., is logically consistent) in less than 1 second. All classes in the ontology are satisfiable.

### G.2 Evaluation

The ontology meets its stated requirements and goals. 
### G.3 Example of use
Examples of use can be seen in our report.
